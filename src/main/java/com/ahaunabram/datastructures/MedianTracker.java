import java.util.PriorityQueue;

/**
 * Utility to keep track if a list of numbers, and return the median at any time.
 * All operations run in Big-Oh = O(log(n)) or better.
 *
 * Implementation use 2 heaps to keep try of the highest and lowest numbers.
 * Since PriorityQueue.head returns the least element
 * and we need a way to get highest element (of the lowest numbers), we store all numbers in loHeap as -ves
 * e.g. 3 and 4 would be added as -3 and -4, hence peek would return least (-4) which really gives us the max (4).
 *
 * This is the solution to a problem from the Heaps lectures in
 * Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1, by Tim Roughgarden
 * https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/62
